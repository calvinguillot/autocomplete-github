# Autocomplete Component

This is a VueJS standalone component. It fetches users and repositories from Github. You can find a demo [here](https://jsfiddle.net/calvinguillot/6b28ux4z/5/).

Use arrows and mouse to navigate, and enter or click to go to a selected item URL.

Due to the nature of the requirements, no `props` are available. Similarly for unauthenticated requests, GitHub rate limit allows you to make up to 10 requests per minute.
